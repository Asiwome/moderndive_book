In this chapter we kick off the third segment of this book, statistical inference, by learning about **sampling**. The concepts behind sampling form the basis of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which we'll cover in Chapters \@ref(confidence-intervals) and \@ref(hypothesis-testing) respectively. We will see that the tools that you learned in the data science segment of this book, in particular data visualization and data wrangling, will also play an important role here in the development of your understanding.  As mentioned before, the concepts throughout this text all build into a culmination allowing you to "think with data."

## Sampling activity {#sampling-activity}

Let's start with a hand-on activity.

### What proportion of this bowl's balls are red?

Take a look at the bowl in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-1). It has a certain number of red and and a certain number of white balls, all of equal size. What proportion of this bowl's balls are red?

```{r sampling-exercise-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A bowl with red and white balls.", purl=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling_bowl_1.jpg")
```

One way to answer this question would be to perform an exhaustive count: remove each ball individually, count the number of red balls and the number of white balls, and divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls. However this would be a long and tedious process. 

### Using shovel once 

Instead of performing an exhaustive count, let's insert a shovel into the bowl as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-2).

```{r sampling-exercise-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Inserting a shovel into the bowl.", purl=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling_bowl_2.jpg")
```

Using the shovel we remove a number of balls as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-3).

```{r sampling-exercise-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fifty balls from the bowl.", purl=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling_bowl_3_cropped.jpg")
```

Observe that 17 of the balls are red and there are a total of 5 x 10 = 50 balls and thus 0.34 = 34% of the shovel's balls are red. The proportion of balls that are red in this shovel is a guess of the proportion of balls that are red in the entire bowl. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count, our guess of 34% took much less time and energy to obtain. 

However say we started this activity over from the beginning. In other words, we replace the 50 balls back into the ball and start over. Would we remove exactly 17 red balls again? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red by exactly 34% again? Maybe? 

What if we repeated this exercise several times? Would I obtain exactly 17 red balls each time? In other words, would our guess at the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red by exactly 34% every time? Surely not. Let's actually do and observe the results with the help of 33 of our friends.

### Using shovel 33 times {#student-shovels}

Each of our 33 friends will do the following: use the shovel to remove 50 balls each, count the number of red balls, use this number to compute the proportion of the 50 balls they removed that are red, return the balls into the bowl, and mix the contents of the bowl a little to not let a previous group;s results influence the next group's set of results. 

```{r sampling-exercise-3b, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Repeating sampling activity 33 times.", purl=FALSE, out.width = "20%"}
#
# Need new picture
#
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling/tactile_2_a.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling/tactile_2_b.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling/tactile_2_c.jpg")
```

However, before returning the balls into the bowl, they are going to mark the proportion of the 50 balls they removed that are red in a histogram as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-4).

```{r sampling-exercise-4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Constructing a histogram of proportions.", purl=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling/tactile_3_a.jpg")
```

Recall from Section \@ref(histograms) that histograms allow us to visualize the *distribution* of a numerical variable: where the values center and in particular how they vary. The resulting hand-drawn histogram can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-5).

```{r sampling-exercise-5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Hand-drawn histogram of 33 proportions.", purl=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling/tactile_3_c.jpg")
```

Observe the following about the histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-5):

* At the low end, one group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.20 = 20% and 0.25 = 25%
* At the high end, another group removed 50 balls from the bowl with proportion between 0.45 = 45% and 0.5 = 50% red.
* However the most frequently occuring proportions were between 0.30 = 30% and 0.35 = 35% red, right in the middle of the distribution.
* The shape of this distribution is somewhat bell-shaped. 

Let's construct this same hand-drawn histogram in R using your data visualization skills that you honed in Chapter \@ref(viz). We saved our 33 groups of friend's proportion red in a data frame `tactile_prop_red` which is included in the `moderndive` package you loaded earlier. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tactile_prop_red
View(tactile_prop_red)
```

Let's display only the first 10 out of 33 rows of `tactile_prop_red`'s contents in Table \@ref(tab:tactilered).

```{r tactilered, echo=FALSE}
tactile_prop_red %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  kable(
    digits = 3,
    caption = "First 10 out of 33 groups' proportion of 50 balls that are red.", 
    booktabs = TRUE,
    longtable = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position", "repeat_header"))
```

Observe for each `group` we have their names, the number of `red_balls` they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 balls that were red `prop_red`. Observe, we also have a variable `replicate` enumerating each of the 33 groups; we chose this name because each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated activity: using the shovel to remove 50 balls and computing the proportion of those balls that are red. 

We visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using a `geom_histogram()` with `binwidth = 0.05` in Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-tactile), which matches our hand-drawn histogram from the earlier Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-5). Recall that using a histogram is appropriate since `prop_red` is a numerical variable. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red") 
```
```{r samplingdistribution-tactile, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50"}
tactile_histogram <- ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white")
tactile_histogram + 
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red")
```


### What are we doing here?

What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical concept of sampling. We would like to know the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red. However, because the bowl has a very large number of balls, performing an exhaustive count of the number of red and white balls in the bowl would be very costly, both in terms of both time and energy. We therefore instead mix the balls and extract a sample of 50 balls using the shovel. Using this sample of 50 balls, we approximate the proportion of the bowl's balls that are red using the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red, 17 red balls out of 50 balls = 34% in our earlier example. 

Moreover, because we mixed the balls before each use of the shovel, the samples were randomly drawn. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. Because the samples were different from each other, we obtained the different proportions red observed in Table \@ref(tab:tactilered). This is known as the concept of *sampling variation*.

In Section \@ref(sampling-simulation) we'll mimic the hands-on sampling activity we just performed in a *computer simulation*; using a computer will allow us to repeat the above sampling activity much more than 33 times. Using a computer, not only will be able to repeat the activity a very large number of times, but we will also be able to repeat it with different sized shovels. 

After these simulations, in Section \@ref(sampling-goal) we'll explicitly articulate our goals for this chapter: understanding the concept of sampling variation and the role that sample size plays in this variation. 

After having armed ourselves with this conceptual understanding of sampling, we'll present you with definitions, terminology, and notation related to sampling in Section \@ref(sampling-framework). As with many disciplines, there are definitions, terminology, and notation that seem very inaccessible and even confusing at first. However, as with many difficult topics, if you truly understand the underlying concepts and practice, practice, practice, you'll be able to master these topics.

To tie the contents of this chapter to the real-word, we'll present an example of one of the most recognizable uses of sampling: polls. In Section \@ref(sampling-case-study) we'll look at a particular case study: a 2013 poll on then President Obama's popularity amongst young Americans, conducted by the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.

We'll close this chapter by generalizing the above sampling from the bowl activity to other scenarios, distiguishing between *random sampling* and *random assignment*, presenting the theoretical result underpinning all our results, and presenting a few mathematical formulas that relate to the concepts and ideas explored in this chapter.

## Computer simulation {#sampling-simulation}

What we performed in Section \@ref(sampling-activity) is a *simulation* of sampling. The crowd-sourced Wikipedia definition of a simulation states: "A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system."^[[Wikipedia entry for simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation)] One example of simulations in practice are a flight simulators: before pilots in training are allowed to fly an actual plane, they first practice on a computer that attempts to mimic the reality of flying an actual plane as best as possible. 

Now you might be thinking that simulations must necssarily take place on computer. However, this is not necessarily true. Take for example crash test dummies: before cars are made available to the market, automobile engineers test their safety by mimicking the reality for passengeres of being in an automobile crash. To distinguish between these two simulation types, we'll term a simulation performed in real-life as a "tactile" simulation done with your hands and to the touch as opposed to a "virtual" simulation performed on a computer. 

Example of a "tactile" simulation          |  Example of "virtual" simulation
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](images/crash-test-dummy.jpg){ height=1.7in }  |  ![](images/flight-simulator.jpg){ height=1.7in }

So while in Section \@ref(sampling-activity) we performed a "tactile" simulation of sampling using an actual bowl and an actual shovel with our hands, in this section we'll perform a "virtual" simulation using a virtual bowl and a virtual shovel with our computers.

<!--
Supplement definition of simulation with idea of "replicates"?
-->

### Using shovel once

Let's start by perfoming the virtual analogue of the tactile sampling simulation we performed in \@ref(sampling-activity). We first need a virtual analogue of the bowl seen in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-1). To this end, we created a data frame called `bowl` whose rows correspond exactly with the contents of the actual bowl; we've included this data frame in the `moderndive` package. 

```{r}
bowl
```

Observe in the output that `bowl` has 2400 rows, telling us that the bowl contains 2400 equally-sized balls. The first variable `ball_ID` is used merely as an "identification variable" for this data frame as discussed in Subsection \@ref(identification-vs-measurement); none of the balls in the actual bowl are marked with numbers. The second variable `color` indicates whether a particular virtual ball i s red or white. Run `View(bowl)` in RStudio and scroll through the contents to convince yourselves that `bowl` is indeed a virtual version of the actual bowl in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-1).

Now that we have a virtual analogue of our bowl, we now need a virtual analogue for the shovel seen in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-2) to generate our random samples of 50 balls. We're going to use the `rep_sample_n()` function included in the `moderndive` package that allows us to take `rep`eated/`rep`licated `samples of size `n`. Run the following and explore `virtual_shovel`'s contents in the spreadsheet viewer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_shovel <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50)
View(virtual_shovel)
```

Let's display only the first 10 out of 50 rows of `virtual_shovel`'s contents in Table \@ref(tab:virtual-shovel).

```{r virtual-shovel, echo=FALSE}
virtual_shovel <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50)
virtual_shovel %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    align = c("r", "r"),
    digits = 3,
    caption = "First 10 sampled balls of 50 in virtual sample",
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

The `ball_ID` variable identifies which of balls from `bowl` are included in our sample of 50 balls and `color` denotes it's color. However what does the `replicate` variable indicate? In `virtual_shovel`'s case, `replicate` is equal to 1 for all 50 rows. This is telling us that these 50 rows correspond to a first repeated/replicated use of the shovel, in other words our first sample. We'll see below when we "virtually" take 33 samples below, `replicate` will take values between 1 and 33. Before we do this, let's compute the proportion of balls in our virtual sample of size 50 that are red. We'll be using the `dplyr` data wrangling verbs you learned in Chapter \@ref(wrangling). Let's breakdown the steps individually:

First, for each of our 50 sampled balls, identify if it is red or not using the boolean algebra. For every row where `color == "red"`, the boolean `TRUE` is returned and for every row where `color` is not equal to `"red"`, the boolean `FALSE` is returned. Let's create a new boolean variable `is_red` using the `mutate()` function from Section \@ref(mutate):

```{r}
virtual_shovel %>% 
  mutate(is_red = color == "red")
```

Second, we compute the number of balls out of 50 that are red using the `summarize()` function. Recall from Section \@ref(summarize) that `summarize()` takes a data frame with many rows and returns a data frame with a single row containing summary statistics that you specify, like `mean()` and `median()`. In this case we use the `sum()`:

```{r}
virtual_shovel %>% 
  mutate(is_red = color == "red") %>% 
  summarize(num_red = sum(is_red))  
```

Why does this work? Because R treats `TRUE` like the number `1` and `FALSE` like the number `0`. So summing the number of `TRUE`'s and `FALSE`'s is equivalent to summing `1`'s and `0`'s, which in the end which counts the number of balls where `color` is `red`.

Third and last, we compute the proportion of the 50 sampled balls that are red by dividing `num_red` by 50:

```{r}
virtual_shovel %>% 
  mutate(is_red = color == "red") %>% 
  summarize(num_red = sum(is_red)) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = num_red / 50)
```

Let's make the above code a little more compact and succinct by combining the first `mutate()` and the `summarize()` as follows:

```{r}
virtual_shovel %>% 
  summarize(num_red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = num_red / 50)
```

Great! 44% of `virtual_shovel`'s 50 balls were red! So based on this particular sample, our guess at the proportion of `bowl`'s balls that are red is 44%. But remember from our earlier tactile sampling activity, that if we repeated this sampling, we would not necessarily obtain a sample of 50 balls with 44% of them being red; there will likely be some variation. 

In fact in Table \@ref(tab:virtual-shovel) we displayed 33 such proportions based on 33 tactile samples and then in Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-exercise-5) we visualized the distribution of the 33 proportions in a histogram. Let's now perform the virtual analogue of having 33 groups of students use the sampling shovel!


### Using shovel 33 times

Recall however in our tactile sampling exercise in Section \@ref(sampling-activity) above that we had 33 groups of students each use the shovel, yielding 33 samples of size 50 balls, which we used to then compute 33 proportions. In other words we *repeated/replicated* the sampling activity 33 times. We can perform this repeated/replicated sampling virtually by once again using our virtual shovel funciton `rep_sample_n()`, but by adding the `reps = 33` argument indicating we want to repeat the sampling 33 times. 

Be sure to scroll through the contents of `virtual_samples` in RStudio's spreadsheet viewer. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 33)
View(virtual_samples)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 33)
```

Observe that while the first 50 rows of `replicate` are equal to `1` the next 50 are equal to `2`. This is indicating that the first 50 rows correspond to the first sample of 50 balls while the next 50 correspond to the second sample of 50 balls. This pattern continues for all `reps = 33` replicates and thus `virtual_samples` has 33 $\times$ 50 = 1650 rows. 

Let's now take the data frame `virtual_samples` with 33 $\times$ 50 = 1650 rows corresponding to 33 samples of size 50 and compute the resulting 33 proportions red. We'll use the same `dplyr` verbs as we did in the previous section, but this time with an additional `group_by()` the `replicate` variable. Recall from Section \@ref(groupby) that by assigning grouping "meta-data" before `summarizing()`, we'll obtain 33 different proportions red:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
View(virtual_prop_red)
```

Let's display only the first 10 out of 33 rows of `virtual_prop_red`'s contents in Table \@ref(tab:tactilered).

```{r virtualred, echo=FALSE}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)

virtual_histogram <- ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white")

virtual_prop_red %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  kable(
    digits = 3,
    caption = "First 10 out of 33 virtual proportion of 50 balls that are red.", 
    booktabs = TRUE,
    longtable = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position", "repeat_header"))
```

Let's visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions red based on 33 virtual samples using a histogram with `binwidth = 0.05` in Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-virtual). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red") 
```
```{r samplingdistribution-virtual, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50"}
virtual_histogram <- ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white")
virtual_histogram + 
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red")
``` 

Observe that occasionally we obtained proportions red that are less than 0.3 = 30%, while occasionally we obtained proportions that are greater than 0.45 = 45%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions red out of 50 balls were between 35% and 40% (for 11 out 33 samples). Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of sampling variation. 

Let's now compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section in Figure \@ref(fig:tactile-vs-virtual). We see that both histograms, in other words the distribution of the 33 proportions red, are *somewhat* somewhat similar in their center and spread, although not identical; these slight differences are again due to random variation. Furthermore both distributions are *somewhat* bell-shaped.

```{r tactile-vs-virtual, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Two distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50"}
bind_rows(
  virtual_prop_red %>% 
    mutate(type = "Virtual sampling"), 
  tactile_prop_red %>% 
    select(replicate, red = red_balls, prop_red) %>% 
    mutate(type = "Tactile sampling")
) %>% 
  mutate(type = factor(type, levels = c("Virtual sampling", "Tactile sampling"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
         title = "Comparing distributions")
```


### Using shovel 1000 times

Now say we want study the variation in proportions red not based on 33 samples but rather a very large number of samples, say 1000 samples. We have two choices at this point. We could make our students manually take 1000 samples of 50 balls and compute the corresponding 1000 proportion red out 50 balls. However, this would be cruel and unusual, as it this would be very tedious and time consuming. This is however where computers excel: for automating long and repetitive tasks and having them performed very quickly. Therefore at this point we will abandon tactile sampling in favor of only virtual sampling. Let's once again use the `rep_sample_n()` function with sample `size` set to 50, but the number of replicates `reps = 1000`. 

Be sure to scroll through the contents of `virtual_samples` in RStudio's spreadsheet viewer. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
View(virtual_samples)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
```


Observe that now `virtual_samples` has 1000 $\times$ 50 = 50,000 rows, instead of the 33 $\times$ 50 = 1650 rows from earlier. Using the same code as earlier, let's take the data frame `virtual_samples` with 1000 $\times$ 50 = 50,000 and compute the resulting 33 proportions red. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
View(virtual_prop_red)
```

Observe that we now have 1000 replicates of `prop_red`, the proportion of 50 balls that are red. Using the same code as earlier, let's now visualize the distribution of these 1000 replicates of `prop_red` in a histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-virtual-1000).

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 1000 proportions red") 
```
```{r samplingdistribution-virtual-1000, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of 1000 proportions based on 33 samples of size 50"}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
virtual_histogram <- ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white")
virtual_histogram + 
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 balls that were red", 
       title = "Distribution of 1000 proportions red")
``` 

Once again, the most frequently occuring proportions red occur between 35% and 40%. Every now and then, we'd obtain proportions are low as between 20% and 25%, and others as high as between 55% and 60%, but those are rarities. Furthermore observe that we now have much more symmetric and smoother bell-shaped distribution. This distribution is in fact a Normal distribution; see Appendix \@ref(appendixA) for a brief discussion on properties of the Normal distribution.


### Using different shovels

We ask ourselves a question now. Say you had three choices of shovels to extract a sample of balls and compute the corresponding proportion of balls in the shovel that are red:

A shovel with 25 slots          |  A shovel with 50 slots  | A shovel with 100 slots
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](images/sampling/shovel_025.jpg){ height=1.7in }  |  ![](images/sampling/shovel_050.jpg){ height=1.7in } | ![](images/sampling/shovel_100.jpg){ height=1.7in } 

Which would you choose? In our experience, most people would choose the shovel with 100 slots since it has the biggest sample size, and thus would yield the "best" guess of the proportion of the bowl's 2400 balls that are red. The three shovels above present with three possible sample sizes. Using our newly developed tools for virtual sampling simulations, let's unpack the effect of having different sample sizes! In other words, for `size = 25`, `size = 50`, and `size = 100`:

1. Virtually use the appropriate shovel to generate 1000 samples with `size` balls.
1. Compute the resulting 1000 replicated of the proportion of the shovel's balls that are red.
1. Visualize the distribution of these 1000 proportion red using a histogram.

Run each of the following code segments individually and then compare the three resulting histograms.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------

```

For easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions). What do you observe?

```{r comparing-sampling-distributions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes"}
# n = 25
virtual_samples_25 <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 25, reps = 1000)
virtual_prop_red_25 <- virtual_samples_25 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 25) %>% 
  mutate(n = 25)

# n = 50
virtual_samples_50 <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
virtual_prop_red_50 <- virtual_samples_50 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50) %>% 
  mutate(n = 50)

# n = 100
virtual_samples_100 <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = 1000)
virtual_prop_red_100 <- virtual_samples_100 %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 100) %>% 
  mutate(n = 100)

virtual_prop <- bind_rows(virtual_prop_red_25, virtual_prop_red_50,virtual_prop_red_100)

ggplot(virtual_prop, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion red", title = "Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes") +
  facet_wrap(~n)
```

Observe that as the sample size increases, the spread of the 1000 replicates of the proportion red decreases. In other words, as the sample size increases, there are less differences due to sampling variation, and the distribution centers more tightly around the same value. Eyeballing Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions), things appear to center more tightly around roughly 40%.

We can be numerically explicit about the amount of spread using the *standard deviation*: a summary statistic that measures the amount of spread and variation within a numerical variable; see Appendix \@ref(appendixA) for a brief discussion on properties of the standard deviation. For all three sample sizes, compute the standard deviation of `sd()` of the 1000 proportions red by running the following data wrangling code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# n = 25
virtual_prop_red_25 %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))

# n = 50
virtual_prop_red_50 %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))

# n = 100
virtual_prop_red_100 %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red))
```

Let's compare these 3 measures of spread of the distributions we in Table \@ref(tab:comparing-n).

```{r comparing-n, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
virtual_prop %>% 
  group_by(n) %>% 
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red)) %>% 
  rename(`sample size` = n, `standard deviation` = sd) %>% 
  kable(
    digits = 3,
      caption = "Comparing the standard deviations of the proportion red for different sample sizes.", 
      booktabs = TRUE
) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

As we observed visually in Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-sampling-distributions), as the sample size increases our numerical measure of spread decreases; there is less variation in our proportions red. In other words, as the sample size increases, our guesses at the true proportion of the bowl's balls that are red get more consistent and precise.

## Sampling framework {#sampling-framework}
### Terminology

Let's now define some concepts and terminology important to understand sampling, being sure to tie things back to the above example. You might have to read this a couple times more as you progress throughout this book, as they are very deeply layered concepts. However as we'll soon see, they are very powerful concepts that open up a whole new world of scientific thinking:

1. **Population**: The population is a set of $N$ observations of interest.
    + Above Ex: Our bowl consisting of $N=2400$ identically-shaped balls. 
1. **Population parameter**: A population parameter is a numerical summary value about the population. In most settings, this is a value that's unknown and you wish you knew it.
    + Above Ex: The true *population proportion $p$* of the balls in the bowl that are red.
    + In this scenario the parameter of interest is the proportion, but in others it could be numerical summary values like the mean, median, etc.
1. **Census**: An exhaustive enumeration/counting of all observations in the population in order to compute the population parameter's numerical value *exactly*.
    + Above Ex: This corresponds to manually going over all $N=2400$ balls and counting the number that are red, thereby allowing us to compute the population proportion $p$ of the balls that are red exactly. 
    + When $N$ is small, a census is feasible. However, when $N$ is large, a census can get very expensive, either in terms of time, energy, or money. 
    + Ex: the Decennial United States census attempts to exhaustively count the US population. Consequently it is a very expensive, but necessary, procedure. 
1. **Sampling**: Collecting a sample of size $n$ of observations from the population. Typically the sample size $n$ is much smaller than the population size $N$, thereby making sampling a much cheaper procedure than a census. 
    + Above Ex: Using the shovel to extract a sample of $n=50$ balls. 
    + It is important to remember that the lowercase $n$ corresponds to the sample size and uppercase $N$ corresponds to the population size, thus  $n \leq N$.
1. **Point estimates/sample statistics**: A summary statistic based on the sample of size $n$ that *estimates* the unknown population parameter.
    + Above Ex: it's the *sample proportion $\widehat{p}$* red of the balls in the sample of size $n=50$. 
    + Key: The sample proportion red $\widehat{p}$ is an *estimate* of the true unknown population proportion red $p$.
1. **Representative sampling**: A sample is said be a *representative sample* if it "looks like the population." In other words, the sample's characteristics are a good representation of the population's characteristics.
    + Above Ex: Does our sample of $n=50$ balls "look like" the contents of the larger set of $N=2400$ balls in the bowl?
1. **Generalizability**: We say a sample is *generalizable* if any results of based on the sample can generalize to the population.
    + Above Ex: Is $\widehat{p}$ a "good guess" of $p$? 
    + In other words, can we *infer* about the true proportion of the balls in the bowl that are red, based on the results of our sample of $n=50$ balls?
1. **Bias**: In a statistical sense, we say *bias* occurs if certain observations in a population have a higher chance of being sampled than others. We say a sampling procedure is *unbiased* if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. 
    + Above Ex: Did each ball, irrespective of color, have an equal chance of being sampled, meaning the sampling was unbiased? We feel since the balls are all of the same size, there isn't any bias in the sampling. If, say, the red balls had a much larger diameter than the white ones then you might have have a higher or lower probability of now sampling red balls.
1. **Random sampling**: We say a sampling procedure is *random* if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion.
    + Above Ex: As long as you mixed the bowl sufficiently before sampling, your samples of size $n=50$ balls would be random. 

### Sampling for inference

Why did we go through the trouble of enumerating all the above concepts and terminology?

**The moral of the story**:

> * If the sampling of a sample of size $n$ is done at **random**, then
> * The sample is **unbiased** and **representative** of the population, thus
> * Any result based on the sample can **generalize** to the population, thus
> * The **point estimate/sample statistic** is a "good guess" of the unknown population parameter of interest

**and thus we have inferred about the population based on our sample. In the above example**:

> * If we properly mix the balls by say stirring the bowl first, then use the shovel to extract a sample of size $n=50$, then
> * The contents of the shovel will "look like" the contents of the bowl, thus
> * Any results based on the sample of $n=50$ balls can generalize to the large bowl of $N=2400$ balls, thus
> * The sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ of the $n=50$ balls in the shovel that are red is a "good guess" of the true population proportion $p$ of the $N=2400$ balls that are red.

**and thus we have inferred some new piece of information about the bowl based on our sample extracted by shovel.**

### Statistical definitions

Sampling distributions are a specific kind of distribution: distributions of *point estimates/sample statistics* based on samples of size $n$ used to estimate an unknown *population parameter*. 

In the case of the histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-tactile), its the distribution of the sample proportion red $\widehat{p}$ based on $n=50$ sampled balls from the bowl, for which we want to estimate the unknown *population proportion* $p$ of the $N=2400$ balls that are red. Sampling distributions describe how values of the sample proportion red $\widehat{p}$ will vary from sample to sample due to **sampling variability** and thus identify "typical" and "atypical" values of $\widehat{p}$. For example

* Obtaining a sample that yields $\widehat{p} = 0.36$ would be considered typical, common, and plausible since it would in theory occur frequently.
* Obtaining a sample that yields $\widehat{p} = 0.8$ would be considered atypical, uncommon, and implausible since it lies far away from most of the distribution.

Let's now ask ourselves the following questions:

1. Where is the sampling distribution centered? 
1. What is the spread of this sampling distribution?

Recall from Section \@ref(summarize) the mean and the standard deviation are two summary statistics that would answer this question:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tactile_prop_red %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(prop_red), sd = sd(prop_red))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary_stats <- tactile_prop_red %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(prop_red), sd = sd(prop_red))
summary_stats %>% 
  kable(digits = 3) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = ifelse(knitr:::is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

Finally, it's important to keep in mind:

1. If the sampling is done in an unbiased and random fashion, in other words we made sure to stir the bowl before we sampled, then the sampling distribution will be guaranteed to be centered at the true unknown population proportion red $p$, or in other words the true number of balls out of 2400 that are red.
1. The spread of this histogram, as quantified by the standard deviation of `r summary_stats %>% pull(sd) %>% round(3)`, is called the **standard error**. It quantifies the uncertainty of our estimates of $p$, which recall are called $\widehat{p}$.
    + **Note**: A large source of confusion. All standard errors are a form of standard deviation, but not all standard deviations are standard errors.

  labs(
    x = expression(paste("Sample proportion red ", hat(p), " based on n = 50")), 
    title = "Sampling distribution: Virtual"
    )
-->



Now let's mimic the above *tactile* sampling, but with *virtual* sampling. We'll resort to virtual sampling because while collecting 33 tactile samples manually is feasible, for large numbers like 1000, things start getting tiresome! That's where a computer can really help: computers excel at performing mundane tasks repeatedly; think of what accounting software must be like!

In Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-virtual), we can start seeing a pattern in the sampling distribution emerge. However, 33 values of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ might not be enough to get a true sense of the distribution. Using 1000 values of $\widehat{p}$ would definitely give a better sense. What are our two options for constructing these histograms?

1. Tactile sampling: Make the 33 groups of students take $1000 / 33 \approx 31$ samples of size $n=50$ each, count the number of red balls for each of the 1000 tactile samples, and then compute the 1000 corresponding values of the sample proportion $\widehat{p}$. However, this would be cruel and unusual as this would take hours!
1. Virtual sampling: Computers are very good at automating repetitive tasks such as this one. This is the way to go!

First, generate 1000 samples of size $n=50$

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
View(virtual_samples)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
virtual_samples <- bowl %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 1000)
```

Then for each of these 1000 samples of size $n=50$, compute the corresponding sample proportions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
View(virtual_prop_red)
````
```{r, echo=FALSE}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)
```

As previously done, let's plot the sampling distribution of these 1000 simulated values of the sample proportion red $\widehat{p}$ with a histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:samplingdistribution-virtual-1000).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Sample proportion red based on n = 50", 
       title = "Sampling distribution of p-hat") 
```
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sampling distribution of 1000 sample proportions based on 1000 tactile samples with n=50"}
virtual_prop_red <- virtual_samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>% 
  summarize(red = sum(color == "red")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red / 50)

ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = "white") +
    labs(
      x = expression(paste("Sample proportion red ", hat(p), " based on n = 50")), 
      title = expression(paste("Sampling distribution of ", hat(p)))
      )
```

Since the sampling is random and thus representative and unbiased, the above sampling distribution is centered at the true population proportion red $p$ of all $N=2400$ balls in the bowl. Eyeballing it, the sampling distribution appears to be centered at around 0.375. 

What is the standard error of the above sampling distribution of $\widehat{p}$ based on 1000 samples of size $n=50$? 

```{r}
virtual_prop_red %>% 
  summarize(SE = sd(prop_red))
```
What this value is saying might not be immediately apparent by itself to someone who is new to sampling. It's best to first compare different standard errors for different sampling schemes based on different sample sizes $n$. We'll do so for samples of size $n=25$, $n=50$, and $n=100$ next.

## Interpretation {#sampling-intepretation}

At this point, you might be saying to yourself: "Big deal, why do we care about this bowl?" As hopefully you'll soon come to appreciate, this sampling bowl exercise is merely a **simulation** representing the reality of many important sampling scenarios in a simplified and accessible setting. One in particular sampling scenario is familiar to many: polling. Whether for market research or for political purposes, polls inform much of the world's decision and opinion making, and understanding the mechanism behind them can better inform you statistical citizenship. We'll tie-in everything we learn in this chapter with an example relating to a 2013 poll on President Obama's approval ratings among young adults in Section \@ref(polls).



---



## Case study: Polls {#sampling-case-study}

In December 4, 2013 National Public Radio reported on a recent poll of President Obama's approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 in an article [Poll: Support For Obama Among Young Americans Eroding](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding). A quote from the article:

> After voting for him in large numbers in 2008 and 2012, young Americans are souring on President Obama.
> 
> According to a new Harvard University Institute of Politics poll, just 41 percent of millennials — adults ages 18-29 — approve of Obama's job performance, his lowest-ever standing among the group and an 11-point drop from April.

Let's tie elements of this story using the concepts and terminology we learned at the outset of this chapter along with our observations from the tactile and virtual sampling simulations:

1. **Population**: Who is the population of $N$ observations of interest?
    + Bowl: $N=2400$ identically-shaped balls
    + Obama poll: $N = \text{?}$ young Americans aged 18-29
1. **Population parameter**: What is the population parameter? 
    + Bowl: The true population proportion $p$ of the balls in the bowl that are red.
    + Obama poll: The true population proportion $p$ of young Americans who approve of Obama's job performance.
1. **Census**: What would a census be in this case? 
    + Bowl: Manually going over all $N=2400$ balls and exactly computing the population proportion $p$ of the balls that are red. 
    + Obama poll: Locating all $N = \text{?}$ young Americans (which is in the millions) and asking them if they approve of Obama's job performance. This would be quite expensive to do!
1. **Sampling**: How do you acquire the sample of size $n$ observations?
    + Bowl: Using the shovel to extract a sample of $n=50$ balls. 
    + Obama poll: One way would be to get phone records from a database and pick out $n$ phone numbers. In the case of the above poll, the sample was of size $n=2089$ young adults. 
1. **Point estimates/sample statistics**: What is the summary statistic based on the sample of size $n$ that *estimates* the unknown population parameter?
    + Bowl: The *sample proportion $\widehat{p}$* red of the balls in the sample of size $n=50$. 
    + Key: The sample proportion red $\widehat{p}$ of young Americans in the sample of size $n=2089$ that approve of Obama's job performance. In this study's case, $\widehat{p} = 0.41$ which is the quoted 41% figure in the article.
1. **Representative sampling**: Is the sample procedure *representative*? In other words, to the resulting samples "look like" the population? 
    + Bowl: Does our sample of $n=50$ balls "look like" the contents of the larger set of $N=2400$ balls in the bowl?
    + Obama poll: Does our sample of $n=2089$ young Americans "look like" the population of all young Americans aged 18-29?
1. **Generalizability**: Are the samples *generalizable* to the greater population?
    + Bowl: Is $\widehat{p}$ a "good guess" of $p$? 
    + Obama poll: Is $\widehat{p} = 0.41$ a "good guess" of $p$? In other words, can we confidently say that 41% of *all* young Americans approve of Obama.
1. **Bias**: Is the sampling procedure unbiased? In other words, do all observations have an equal chance of being included in the sample?
    + Bowl: Here, I would say it is unbiased. All balls are equally sized as evidenced by the slots of the $n=50$ shovel, and thus no particular color of ball can be favored in our samples over others. 
    + Obama poll: Did all young Americans have an equal chance at being represented in this poll? For example, if this was conducted using a database of only mobile phone numbers, would people without mobile phones be included? What if those who disapproved of Obama were less likely to agree to take part? What about if this were an internet poll on a certain news website? Would non-readers of this this website be included?
1. **Random sampling**: Was the sampling random?
    + Bowl: As long as you mixed the bowl sufficiently before sampling, your samples would be random?
    + Obama poll: Random sampling is a necessary assumption for all of the above to work.  Most articles reporting on polls take this assumption as granted. In our Obama poll, you'd have to ask the group that conducted the poll: The Harvard University Institute of Politics.
    
Recall the punchline of all the above:

> * If the sampling of a sample of size $n$ is done at **random**, then
> * The sample is **unbiased** and **representative** of the population, thus
> * Any result based on the sample can **generalize** to the population, thus
> * The **point estimate/sample statistic** is a "good guess" of the unknown population parameter of interest

and thus we have *inferred* about the population based on our sample. In the bowl example:

> * If we properly mix the balls by say stirring the bowl first, then use the shovel to extract a sample of size $n=50$, then
> * The contents of the shovel will "look like" the contents of the bowl, thus
> * Any results based on the sample of $n=50$ balls can generalize to the large bowl of $N=2400$ balls, thus
> * The sample proportion $\widehat{p}$ of the $n=50$ sampled balls in the shovel that are red is a "good guess" of the true population proportion $p$ of the $N=2400$ balls that are red.

and thus we have inferred some new piece of information about the bowl based on our sample extracted by shovel: the proportion of balls that are red. In the Obama poll example:

> * If we had a way of contacting a randomly chosen sample of 2089 young Americans and poll their approval of Obama, then
> * These 2089 young Americans would "look like" the population of all young Americans, thus
> * Any results based on this sample of 2089 young Americans can generalize to entire population of all young Americans, thus
> * The reported sample approval rating of 41% of these 2089 young Americans is a "good guess" of the true approval rating amongst *all* young Americans.

So long story short, this poll's guess of Obama's approval rating was 41%. However is this the end of the story when understanding the results of a poll?  If you read further in the article, it states:

> The online survey of 2,089 adults was conducted from Oct. 30 to Nov. 11, just weeks after the federal government shutdown ended and the problems surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act began to take center stage. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.

Note the term *margin of error*, which here is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.  This is saying that a typical range of errors for polls of this type is about $\pm 2.1\%$, in words from about 2.1% too small to about 2.1% too big. These errors are caused by *sampling variation*, the same sampling variation you saw studied in the histograms in Sections \@ref(tactile) on our tactile sampling simulations and Sections \@ref(virtual) on our virtual sampling simulations.

In this case of polls, any variation from the true approval rating is an "error" and a reasonable range of errors is the margin of error. We'll see in the next chapter that this what's known as a 95% confidence interval for the unknown approval rating. We'll study confidence intervals using a new package for our data science and statistical toolbox: the `infer` package for statistical inference.

```

We'll cover the first four scenarios in this chapter on confidence intervals and the following one on hypothesis testing:

* Scenario 2 about means. Ex: the average age of pennies.
* Scenario 3 about differences in proportions between two groups. Ex: the difference in high school completion rates for Canadians vs non-Canadians. We call this a situation of *two-sample* inference.
* Scenario 4 is similar to 3, but its about the means of two groups. Ex: the difference in average test scores for the morning section of a class versus the afternoon section of a class. This is another situation of *two-sample* inference.

In Chapter \@ref(inference-for-regression) on inference for regression, we'll cover Scenarios 5 & 6 about the regression line. In particular we'll see that the fitted regression line from Chapter \@ref(regression) on basic regression, $\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x$, is in fact an estimate of some true population regression line $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x$ based on a sample of $n$ pairs of points $(x, y)$. Ex: Recall our sample of $n=463$ instructors at the UT Austin from the `evals` data set in Chapter \@ref(regression). Based on the results of the fitted regression model of teaching score with beauty score as an explanatory/predictor variable, what can we say about this relationship for *all* instructors, not just those at the UT Austin?

In most cases, we don't have the population values as we did with the `bowl` of balls. We only have a single sample of data from a larger population. We'd like to be able to make some reasonable guesses about population parameters using that single sample to create a range of plausible values for a population parameter. This range of plausible values is known as a **confidence interval** and will be the focus of this chapter. And how do we use a single sample to get some idea of how other samples might vary in terms of their statistic values? One common way this is done is via a process known as **bootstrapping** that will be the focus of the beginning sections of this chapter.

### Theory: Central Limit Theorem {#sampling-conclusion-central-limit-theorem}

What you did in Section \@ref(tactile) and \@ref(virtual) was demonstrate a very famous theorem, or mathematically proven truth, called the *Central Limit Theorem*. It loosely states that when sample means and sample proportions are based on larger and larger samples, the sampling distribution corresponding to these point estimates get

1. More and more normal
1. More and more narrow

Shuyi Chiou, Casey Dunn, and Pathikrit Bhattacharyya created the following three minute and 38 second video explaining this crucial theorem to statistics using as examples, what else?

1. The average weight of wild bunny rabbits!
1. The average wing span of dragons!

### Closing notes 

This chapter serves as an introduction to the theoretical underpinning of the statistical inference techniques that will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter \@ref(confidence-intervals) for confidence intervals and Chapter \@ref(hypothesis-testing) for hypothesis testing.
